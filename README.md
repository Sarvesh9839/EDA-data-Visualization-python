# EDA-data-Visualization-python
To visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python, and understand the difference between univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis

1.	Univariate Analysis
Analysis of a single variable.
Goal: Understand distribution, spread, and central tendency.
Examples: Histogram of marks, boxplot of salaries.


3.	Bivariate Analysis
Analysis of the relationship between two variables.
Goal: Identify correlation or comparison.
Examples: Scatter plot (height vs weight), bar chart (city vs sales).


5.	Multivariate Analysis
Analysis of three or more variables together.
Goal: Explore combined influence and complex relationships.
Examples: Scatter plot with hue (age vs income divided by gender), heatmaps.
